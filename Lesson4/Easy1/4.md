# Question

If we have a class AngryCat how do we create a new instance of this class?

The AngryCat class might look something like this:

```ruby
class AngryCat
  def hiss
    puts "Hisssss!!!"
  end
end
```

# Answer

You create a new class by calling `::new` on the class itself like so: 
`AngryCat.new`. If `AngryCat` defined `#initialize`, it would be called when 
`::new` is called. If `#initialize` has parameters, `::new` would require the 
same parameters.
