# Question

If we have a Car class and a Truck class and we want to be able to go_fast, 
how can we add the ability for them to go_fast using the module Speed? How can 
you check if your Car or Truck can now go fast?

```ruby
module Speed
  def go_fast
    puts "I am a #{self.class} and going super fast!"
  end
end

class Car
  def go_slow
    puts "I am safe and driving slow."
  end
end

class Truck
  def go_very_slow
    puts "I am a heavy truck and like going very slow."
  end
end
```

# Answer

Both Car and Truck need to add `include Speed` to their definition. You could 
call `#go_fast` on Car or Truck. If it doens't crash, they implement `Speed`.
Yay duck typing.
