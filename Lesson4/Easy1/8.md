# Question

If we have a class such as the one below:

```ruby
class Cat
  @@cats_count = 0

  def initialize(type)
    @type = type
    @age  = 0
    @@cats_count += 1
  end

  def self.cats_count
    @@cats_count
  end
end
```

In the name of the cats_count method we have used self. What does self refer to 
in this context?

# Answer

self refers to the Class itself, not an instantiated object. self.cats_count is 
a class method and can only be called from the class itself, not from objects 
of the class.
