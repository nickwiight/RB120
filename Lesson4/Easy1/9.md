# Question

If we have the class below, what would you need to call to create a new 
instance of this class.

```ruby
class Bag
  def initialize(color, material)
    @color = color
    @material = material
  end
end
```

# Answer
You would need to call `Bag.new`, but you would also need to pass in two arguments, 
a `color` argument and a `material` argument.
