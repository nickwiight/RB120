# Question

In the last question we had a module called Speed which contained a go_fast 
method. We included this module in the Car class as shown below.
```ruby
module Speed
  def go_fast
    puts "I am a #{self.class} and going super fast!"
  end
end

class Car
  include Speed
  def go_slow
    puts "I am safe and driving slow."
  end
end
```

When we called the go_fast method from an instance of the Car class (as shown 
below) you might have noticed that the string printed when we go fast includes 
the name of the type of vehicle we are using. How is this done?

```ruby
>> small_car = Car.new
>> small_car.go_fast
#=> I am a Car and going super fast!
```

# Answer

`self.class` returns the class of the calling object. Because the object calling 
`#go_fast` is the `Car`, `self.class` returns `Car`. Because `self.class` is 
called in string interpolation, the class name is converted to a `String`.
