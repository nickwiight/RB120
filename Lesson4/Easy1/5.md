# Question

Which of these two classes would create objects that would have an instance 
variable and how do you know?

```ruby
class Fruit
  def initialize(name)
    name = name
  end
end

class Pizza
  def initialize(name)
    @name = name
  end
end
```

# Answer

`Pizza` would create objects with an instance variable. Instance variables are 
defined with `@` before their name. Instance variables are only initialized 
when the method they are in is called for the first time. Since `#initialize` 
is called when the object is created, `@name` is always initialized.

Huh. `#instance_variables` returns an array of all instance variables.
