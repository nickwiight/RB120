# Question

Given the class below, if we created a new instance of the class and then called 
to_s on that instance we would get something like `"#<Cat:0x007ff39b356d30>"`

```ruby
class Cat
  def initialize(type)
    @type = type
  end
end
```

How could we go about changing the to_s output on this method to look like this: 
I am a tabby cat? (this is assuming that "tabby" is the type we passed in during 
initialization).

# Answer

```ruby
def to_s
  "I am a #{@type} cat"
end
```
could also add an attr_reader/accessor type and remove the `@`.
