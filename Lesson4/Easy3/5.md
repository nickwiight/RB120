# Question

If I have the following class:

```ruby
class Television
  def self.manufacturer
    # method logic
  end

  def model
    # method logic
  end
end
```

What would happen if I called the methods like shown below?

```ruby
tv = Television.new
tv.manufacturer
tv.model

Television.manufacturer
Television.model
```

# Answer

Line 21 would throw an error, because `::manufacturer` is a class method and 
line 25 would throw an error, because `#model` is an instance method.
