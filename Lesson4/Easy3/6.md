# Question

If we have a class such as the one below:

```ruby
class Cat
  attr_accessor :type, :age

  def initialize(type)
    @type = type
    @age  = 0
  end

  def make_one_year_older
    self.age += 1
  end
end
```

In the make_one_year_older method we have used self. What is another way we 
could write this method so we don't have to use the self prefix?

# Answer

We could just remove the self prefix. It's not neccessary. Right?
The answer was to replace it with @? Okay.
