# Question

In the last question we had the following classes:

```ruby
class Greeting
  def greet(message)
    puts message
  end
end

class Hello < Greeting
  def hi
    greet("Hello")
  end
end

class Goodbye < Greeting
  def bye
    greet("Goodbye")
  end
end
```

If we call Hello.hi we get an error message. How would you fix this?

# Answer

I would either implement a `self.hi` method or convert `#hi` to `::hi`.
Could also create an instance of `Greeting` and call `#greet` from it in `#hi`.
