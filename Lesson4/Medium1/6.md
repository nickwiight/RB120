# Question

If we have these two methods in the Computer class:

```ruby
class Computer
  attr_accessor :template

  def create_template
    @template = "template 14231"
  end

  def show_template
    template
  end
end
```

and

```ruby
class Computer
  attr_accessor :template

  def create_template
    @template = "template 14231"
  end

  def show_template
    self.template
  end
end
```

What is the difference in the way the code works?

# Answer

Nothing. But avoid self where possible. self can be avoided in getters, but not 
setters, so you don't just initialize a local variable.
