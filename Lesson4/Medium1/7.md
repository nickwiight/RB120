# Question

How could you change the method name below so that the method name is more 
clear and less repetitive?

```ruby
class Light
  attr_accessor :brightness, :color

  def initialize(brightness, color)
    @brightness = brightness
    @color = color
  end

  def light_status
    "I have a brightness level of #{brightness} and a color of #{color}"
  end

end
```

# Answer

Remove light_. It would be called from a light object, so it doesn't need the 
reminder of what kind of status it is.
