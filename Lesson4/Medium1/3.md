# Question

In the last question Alan showed Alyssa this code which keeps track of items 
for a shopping cart application:

```ruby
class InvoiceEntry
  attr_reader :quantity, :product_name

  def initialize(product_name, number_purchased)
    @quantity = number_purchased
    @product_name = product_name
  end

  def update_quantity(updated_count)
    quantity = updated_count if updated_count >= 0
  end
end
```

Alyssa noticed that this will fail when update_quantity is called. Since 
quantity is an instance variable, it must be accessed with the @quantity 
notation when setting it. One way to fix this is to change attr_reader to 
attr_accessor and change quantity to self.quantity.

Is there anything wrong with fixing it this way?

# Answer

It changes what is publically available to objects outside the class. 
update_quantity has a guard that quatity= does not, which could be bypassed.
