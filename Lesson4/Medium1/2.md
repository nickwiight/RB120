# Question

Alan created the following code to keep track of items for a shopping cart 
application he's writing:

```ruby
class InvoiceEntry
  attr_reader :quantity, :product_name

  def initialize(product_name, number_purchased)
    @quantity = number_purchased
    @product_name = product_name
  end

  def update_quantity(updated_count)
    # prevent negative quantities from being set
    quantity = updated_count if updated_count >= 0
  end
end
```

Alyssa looked at the code and spotted a mistake. "This will fail when 
update_quantity is called", she says.

Can you spot the mistake and how to address it?

# Answer

Line 12 is creating a local variable istead of calling the quantity setter. 
This is because there is only a attr_reader for quantity, so there isn't a 
setter declared for quantity. This can be fixed by adding a @ before quantity, 
or by changing quantity from attr_reader to attr_accessor.
