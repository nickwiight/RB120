# Question

If I have the following class:

```ruby
class Television
  def self.manufacturer
    # method logic
  end

  def model
    # method logic
  end
end
```

Which one of these is a class method (if any) and how do you know? How would you 
call a class method?

# Answer

`self.namufacturer` is a class method. Class methods are prefixed with `self.`. 
You call a class method by calling it from the class itself. 
`Television.manufacturer`
