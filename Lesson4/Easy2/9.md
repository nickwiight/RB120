# Question

If we have this class:

```ruby
class Game
  def play
    "Start the game!"
  end
end

class Bingo < Game
  def rules_of_play
    #rules of play
  end
end
```

What would happen if we added a play method to the Bingo class, keeping in mind 
that there is already a method of this name in the Game class that the Bingo 
class inherits from.


# Answer

It would overwrite `Game#play`, preventing its execution in favor of the 
execution of `Bingo#play`, unless `Bingo#play` implements `super`, which would 
call `Game#play`.
