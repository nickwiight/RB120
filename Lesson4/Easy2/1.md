  def predict_the_future
    "You will " + choices.sample
  end

  def choices
    ["eat a nice lunch", "take a nap soon", "stay at work late"]
  end
end
```

What is the result of executing the following code:

```ruby
oracle = Oracle.new
oracle.predict_the_future
```

It would output: `"You will "`, and then randomly select one of the values of 
the array initialized in `#choices`.
