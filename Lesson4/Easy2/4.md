# Question

What could you add to this class to simplify it and remove two methods from the 
class definition while still maintaining the same functionality?

```ruby
class BeesWax
  def initialize(type)
    @type = type
  end

  def type
    @type
  end

  def type=(t)
    @type = t
  end

  def describe_type
    puts "I am a #{@type} of Bees Wax"
  end
end
```

# Answer
`attr_accessor type` generates getters and setters for `type`.
