# Question

If we have this class:

```ruby
class Game
  def play
    "Start the game!"
  end
end
```

And another class:

```ruby
class Bingo
  def rules_of_play
    #rules of play
  end
end
```

What can we add to the Bingo class to allow it to inherit the play method from 
the Game class?

# Answer

Add ` < Game` to the right of `class Bingo`.
