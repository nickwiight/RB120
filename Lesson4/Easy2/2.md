# Question

We have an Oracle class and a RoadTrip class that inherits from the Oracle class.

```ruby
class Oracle
  def predict_the_future
    "You will " + choices.sample
  end

  def choices
    ["eat a nice lunch", "take a nap soon", "stay at work late"]
  end
end

class RoadTrip < Oracle
  def choices
    ["visit Vegas", "fly to Fiji", "romp in Rome"]
  end
end
```

What is the result of the following:

```ruby
trip = RoadTrip.new
trip.predict_the_future
```

# Answer

`Roadtrip#choices` overrides `Oracle#choices`, so when `#predict_the_future` is 
called, it selects from the array in `Roadtrip#choices`.
