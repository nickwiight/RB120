# Question

How do you find where Ruby will look for a method when that method is called? 
How can you find an object's ancestors?

```ruby
module Taste
  def flavor(flavor)
    puts "#{flavor}"
  end
end

class Orange
  include Taste
end

class HotSauce
  include Taste
end
```

What is the lookup chain for Orange and HotSauce?

# Answer

Ruby check's the class of the caller, then goes up it's ancestors. You can find 
an object's ancestors with `::ancestors`. Ancestors check's all mixins before 
moving to the next parent.

Both classes start with `self`, theng to to `Taste`, `Object`, `Kernel`, 
`Basic Object`.
