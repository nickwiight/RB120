# Question

If we have a class such as the one below:

```ruby
class Cat
  @@cats_count = 0

  def initialize(type)
    @type = type
    @age  = 0
    @@cats_count += 1
  end

  def self.cats_count
    @@cats_count
  end
end
```

Explain what the @@cats_count variable does and how it works. What code would 
you need to write to test your theory?

# Answer

The `@@cats_count` variable is a class variable. It is shared among every instance 
of `Cat`. When `Cat` is instantiated, `@@cats_count` is incremented by one. 
`self.cats_count` is a class method that returns `@@cats_count`.
This can be tested by writing `Cat.new` followed by `Cat.cats_count"`
